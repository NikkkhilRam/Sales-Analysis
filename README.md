# Sales-Analysis


In the data cleaning phase, we will perform tasks such as dropping NaN values, removing rows based on a condition, and converting the data types of certain columns using methods such as to_numeric, to_datetime, and astype.

In the data exploration phase, we will use pandas and matplotlib to answer business questions such as determining the best month for sales, identifying the top-selling city, determining the optimal time to display advertisements, identifying commonly sold products, and determining the top-selling product. Methods we may use include combining multiple CSV files into a single DataFrame using pd.concat, adding new columns, parsing cells as strings, applying functions using the .apply() method, grouping data using groupby, creating visualizations such as bar charts and line graphs, and labeling the graphs.
